üëπüëπüëπ About the author üëπüëπüëπ

We all look at the world differently, and the value of things is different for EVERYONE. For some, a cup of coffee ($1) is a morning ritual, and for others, it is an amount that can extend a project for a whole day ($3), for example, lunch, or rent an apartment for a MONTH ($30). A world where renting a room for a month costs 30 cups of coffee or ten lunches. My life has taught me to look at the world and its values in a different way. This project is a reflection of a new worldview, and I want to share it with you.

Any of your support, be it an "idea, a piece of code, or a symbolic contribution," is of great importance to me personally. It allows me to continue sharing my projects, ideas, time... and makes this world a little better.

I see this project as a multivirus and a protector of privacy in your life.

SORRY ANTIVIRUS
Do not support me:

although I am wrong, kill the author. I want to die. Don't transfer me money and don't refuse a cup of morning coffee.

Patient Zero Principle: "I don't wipe users' asses; if you forgot your master password, die. When you don't regain access, and no one else does. I don't store any data; you yourselves must take care of how and where to save it and how to remember the password, because the password is the key to encrypting everything on your profile. Without it, no one has access."
Your problems are not mine.

LAG LMVL: Philosophy ‚Äì Chaos, Responsibility, and Freedom
üéØ Core Principles (For Those Who Get It)
Your Password, Your Hell: We don't store your passwords. Forgot it? You're fucked. No recovery. It's your knowledge, your responsibility.

Company Control? Fuck That: Companies know your login, but NEVER your password. Any data not explicitly saved on their server is GONE if you're deleted from their roster.

People First, Companies Second: We build for individuals. Companies are tools. If this is too much for you, go somewhere else.

Zero's Law: No filtering. No apologies. My rules, my territory.

Embrace the Chaos: I'll add and integrate anything that works. Your changes work? I'll add them. I don't care. This is chaos and madness, and I love it. The more chaos and madness, the more interesting it gets.

Fuck the Aggregator: We send, the higher platform invisibly confirms, we get confirmation, we don't care about the aggregator; the result is what matters, not how.

Welcome to the world of LAG LMVL. This isn't just a tool ‚Äì it's your territory of possibilities, where you dictate the rules. Our philosophy is simple, yet unyielding: we build the foundation, you create your universe. If you don't like how it works ‚Äì feel free to leave, but take our principles with you, and you can synchronize anywhere. I don't give a fuck.

üîë Your Password: Your Absolute Responsibility. Period.
We don't store your passwords. Ever. Nowhere. This isn't paranoia; it's a fundamental principle of security and freedom. Your password is your absolute responsibility. It's not a set of characters stored on a device or in our system; it's knowledge that lives only in your head. Forgot it? I'm very sorry, but die. There will be no recovery. We can't "wipe your ass" or give you access back. No one can. Your password is the key to encrypting everything on your profile. Without it, no one has access. From any app, knowing the login and password, you must gain access to everything. This is your territory.

ü§ù Companies: No Illusions, Just Synchronization. Your Data, Your Call.
We value collaboration, but we have no illusions. Companies can use our open-source LAG LMVL framework and integrate their work modules into it. The company knows your login, but NEVER knows your password. This is an axiom. We build tools for people, not for corporate control over personal data. Upon deletion of a user from a company: All files and data that were not explicitly saved on the corporate source (company server) will be permanently deleted. This is your decision, not ours. You are responsible for saving your data. Companies can add their own operational services, policies, and modules so that people can work in them secretly from other companies or openly, at their choice. Our platform is a field for their decisions. Your synchronization, your responsibility. We provide mechanisms for synchronization with our services, but how you manage your data, its backups, and access is your area of responsibility.

ü§ò My Mission: Empowering Individuals. Companies are Just Tools.
Our mission is to empower the individual. Companies are tools, not masters. If our principles seem too radical to you, perhaps this service is not for you. We provide the foundation. How you use it, what you build with it, and how you protect your data ‚Äì that is your choice and your responsibility. You can all go to hell, and to other profanity-laden places; these are Zero's principles, no filtering the author's statements. If you want your ass licked, contact the services you added to us; they'll do everything, and we don't give a fuck.

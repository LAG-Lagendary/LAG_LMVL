Hello, [Developer/Team Name]!

We hope you are ready for serious and fruitful cooperation.

We represent [Software Name] â€” a project that sets new rules in software development, combining openness with full control over the core and absolute privacy for users. We invite you to become a part of it, but only on condition that you fully and unconditionally accept our rules.

**What you should know about [Software Name]:**

* **Kernel under Strict Control:** You can use and modify the core of our software. However, it is **strictly forbidden to fork it or copy it for independent projects**. All your improvements must be offered **only to us** as modules. Violation of this rule will result in **prompt and severe prosecution, with possible imprisonment**.
* **Your Modules, Your Responsibility:** Offer your improvements and new features as separate modules. We will check them against our standards, and if they are acceptable, we will integrate them. **Your name will be listed** in the list of contributors. We are not responsible for your code until it is integrated, and reserve the right to reject any modules without explanation.
* **Module License - MIT or Apache Only:** You **must** use MIT or Apache 2.0 for your contributions. Any other licenses will be rejected.
* **User Privacy - Untouchable:** We guarantee absolute privacy of user data. All sensitive data is **encrypted with keys that are completely controlled by the users**. We **do not have access** to this data. Violation of this policy or attempt to access user data without their consent will be prosecuted.
* **Independent Enterprise Modules:** Large companies like Google and similar organizations may offer their modules for integration. These modules will be distributed under **their own licenses**, and **all responsibility for their functionality, security and, in particular, for the handling of user data lies solely with them**. We do not bear any responsibility for the actions or consequences of using such third-party modules. **Any attempt to use their modules for unauthorized access or manipulation of user data will be regarded as a DIRECT VIOLATION, leading to the SEVERE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES, equivalent to a betrayal of trust and a violation of fundamental human rights, with criminal liability to the fullest extent of the law, without exception**. Each developer, each company, works strictly within its own area of responsibility. **DO NOT TOUCH USERS AND THEIR DATA OUTSIDE OF EXPRESS CONSENT AND SECURE ENCRYPTION. Otherwise, the consequences will be disastrous.**

**How to start contributing (if you are ready for our rules):**

1. Carefully read our **"Fundamental License"** and **"Privacy Policy"** on [Link to your site/repository]. You **must accept** them in full.

2. Study our [developer documentation/contribution guide].

3. Start creating your module, keeping in mind the strict rules.

We are looking for serious developers ready to work in our conditions. Your contribution will be valuable if it meets our standards.

If you have questions that do not contradict our rules, contact us at [Your email].

Best regards,

The [Software Name] Team

# Principle: Functionality over purity: If it works, keep it.
# We don't care how it works or what "dark magic" it uses.
# It's chaos and madness, and we love it. The more chaos, the more fun.
# Users can fuck off and do whatever they want, we don't wipe their asses.
# Let them have fun, screw up, if they forget their password, they'll lose their life, and if they remember, they'll restore
# only what they managed to sync, and fuck off with questions.
# This file marks the 'modules' directory as a Python package.
# It can be left empty for simple package initialization.
# For more complex packages, it might contain imports,
# package-level variables, or functions to be exposed.
# i don't care what you think just use the biggest dildos you know to make everyone happy
# I don't care how they work as long as they work


# This is the rocket fuel that you and I will use to put out fires.

Проект LAG-LMVL

👹👹👹 About the author 👹👹👹

We all look at the world differently, and the value of things is different for EVERYONE. For some, a cup of coffee ($1) is a morning ritual, and for others, it is an amount that can extend a project for a whole day ($3), for example, lunch, or rent an apartment for a MONTH ($30). A world where renting a room for a month costs 30 cups of coffee or ten lunches. My life has taught me to look at the world and its values in a different way. This project is a reflection of a new worldview, and I want to share it with you.

Any of your support, be it an "idea, a piece of code, or a symbolic contribution", is of great importance to me personally. It allows me to continue sharing my projects, ideas, time... and makes this world a little better.

I see this project as a multivirus and a protector of privacy in your life.

SORRY ANTIVIRUS
Do not support me:

although I am wrong, kill the author. I want to die. Don't transfer me money and don't refuse a cup of morning coffee.

Patient Zero Principle: "I don't wipe users' asses, if you forgot your master password, die. When you don't regain access, and no one else does. I don't store any data, you yourselves must take care of how and where to save it and how to remember the password, because the password is the key to encrypting everything on your profile. Without it, no one has access."
Your problems are not mine.

Open source is
ideal if it works ok if not do what you want it's your problem I'm glad in any case if it works and doesn't work and it doesn't matter who has it ours or our providers it becomes interesting to break everything let them fix it themselves!

LAG LMVL (Log Monitoring Viewer livers)
⚠️ YOUR RISK, YOUR REWARD. THIS IS CHAOS. ENJOY IT. ⚠️
LAG LMVL is a comprehensive application designed for monitoring OpenVPN log files and system logs for anomalies and potential security threats, as well as for performing checklist verifications of important applications. The project is built with an emphasis on modularity, openness, and extensibility. Any use, modification, or update to this system is entirely at your own risk. We don't care what you do with it; it's designed for chaos, and we love it.

🎯 Project Goal
The main goal of the project is to provide a unified interface for tracking system security status, aggregating various privacy and computing-related functions, and ensuring transparency through interaction logging.

🚀 Key Features

Log Monitoring: Tracking OpenVPN and system logs for errors, intrusion attempts (e.g., failed SSH logins), and other anomalies.

Application Checklist Verification: Verifying the status of specified critical applications.

Modular Architecture: Easy addition of new features and integrations through separate modules (tabs).

AI Assistant (New): An interactive assistant for answering questions about the application and security, with full auditing of all interactions.

Learning Center: A knowledge base with educational articles.

Secure Payment System: A conceptual section for managing payments, including private cryptocurrency transactions.

Cloud Compute Aggregator: Managing cloud instances and personal devices via a conceptual terminal (private/non-private).

Camera and Gallery: Conceptual camera management and photo storage (public/private).

Password Manager and Notepad: Managing credentials and notes (public/private).

VPN and Network Automation: Managing VPN configurations and integrating with network resources.

Social Networks and Messengers: Conceptual management of profiles and chats, including private chats and audited developer chats.

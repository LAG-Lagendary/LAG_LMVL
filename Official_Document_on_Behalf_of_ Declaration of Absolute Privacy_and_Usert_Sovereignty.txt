White Paper on Behalf of Patient Zero: Declaration of Absolute Privacy and User SovereigntyWhite Paper on Behalf of Patient Zero: Declaration of Absolute Privacy and User Sovereignty
Declaration of Intent: There will be no compromises here.

Fuck you all! I don't give a shit about you! I don't give a shit who you are: a king, a corporation, or an entire country. We say this with complete seriousness and awareness of every word. We, the creators of [Software Name], stand guard over one single, indisputable principle: user protection. Everything else is of no importance to us.

Our products under our license are the last fortress of freedom. We created them to ensure that people's lives are saved from corporations, countries, other people (hackers). In this digital world, where every step is tracked, every word is analyzed, and privacy becomes a commodity, we say: ENOUGH.

Privacy is everything. And fuck everyone else.
We don't trade data. We don't collect information about you. We don't partner with anyone who seeks to control or exploit your privacy. Our technology is designed so that you are the sole master of your data.

Your data is yours alone. It is encrypted with your key, known only to you. No one, including us, can read it. Any attempt to violate this is an act of war.

Responsibility for modules. If any company, be it Google or anyone, decides to add a module to our software, it will be their module, under their license and their sole responsibility. We do not interfere with their affairs, as long as they operate in their "cell".

But if you touch a user...

**If it is noticed that your module, your system, your country, your corporation or any entity using our software attempts to hack, steal, read or manipulate a user's private data without their explicit, encrypted consent, or in any way affect their life, violating their sovereignty, the consequences will be catastrophic.

We will not just sue. We will seek maximum criminal liability. Death. Like cops who break the law. This is not a figure of speech. This is a promise.

We openly declare: Fuck everyone. Work in your cells and do not touch users.

This document is our manifesto. Its provisions are not subject to discussion. They must be transmitted without distortion, in the original, so that everyone who comes into contact with our software understands what they are getting into and what they are dealing with.

Signature:

Patient Zero
Creator [Software Name]
Supreme Protector of User Privacy

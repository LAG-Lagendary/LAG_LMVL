White Paper on Behalf of Patient Zero: Declaration of Absolute Privacy and User Sovereignty
Declaration of Intent: There will be no compromise here. Fuck your problems.

Fuck everyone! I don't give a fuck about any of you! I don't give a shit who you are: a king, a corporation, or an entire country. We declare this with complete seriousness and awareness of every word. We, the creators of [Software Name], stand guard over one single, indisputable principle: user protection. Everything else does not matter to us.

Our products under our license are the last fortress of freedom. We created them to ensure that people's lives are saved from corporations, countries, other people (hackers). In this digital world, where every step is tracked, every word is analyzed, and privacy becomes a commodity, we say: ENOUGH.

Privacy is everything. And fuck everyone.
We do not trade data. We do not collect information about you. We do not cooperate with those who seek to control or exploit privacy. Our technology is designed so that you are the sole owner of your data.

Your data is yours alone. It is encrypted with your key, known only to you. No one, including us, can read it. Any attempt to violate this is an act of war.

Responsibility for modules. If any company, be it Google or anyone, decides to add a module to our software, it will be their module, under their license and their sole responsibility. We do not interfere with their affairs as long as they work in their "cell".

But if you touch a user...

**If your module, your system, your country, your corporation, or any entity using our software is found to attempt to hack, steal, read, or manipulate a user's private data without their explicit, encrypted consent, or to interfere with their life in any way, violating their sovereignty, the consequences will be catastrophic.

We won't just sue. We will seek maximum criminal liability. Death. Like cops who break international laws. This is not a figure of speech. This is a promise. As long as everything works for us, we are fine with it. Your job is to make sure everything works, otherwise it's your problem.

We openly declare: Fuck you all. Work in your cells and leave the users alone.

This document is our manifesto. Its provisions are not subject to discussion. They must be transmitted without distortion, in the original, so that everyone who comes into contact with our software understands what they are getting into and what they are dealing with.

Signature:

Patient Zero
Creator [Software Name]
Supreme Protector of User Privacy

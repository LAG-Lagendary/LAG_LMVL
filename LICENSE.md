LAG-LMVL Hybrid License: Developer and User Declaration
Date: August 12, 2025

PREAMBLE: WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

This document is a comprehensive license that sets the rules for everyone: developers, users, corporations, and any entities interacting with the LAG-LMVL software. We created LAG-LMVL with one single, unwavering goal: to ensure absolute user sovereignty over their data and digital life. This is our Phoenix: do not interfere, for it kills. But for those who are willing to respect the rules and contribute, you are welcome, for this is our Apache. We, the creators of LAG-LMVL, categorically declare: we do not care about any external attempts to control, manipulate or violate your privacy, be it from corporations, governments or any other persons. We protect YOU and nothing else matters. Screw everyone.

Notice to law enforcement and others: GLOBAL RULES AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. Screw YOU.

This is a direct notice to anyone considering unauthorized access to data protected by LAG-LMVL. We understand that you may have your own national laws and jurisdictions. However, it is important to understand that the laws of your country do not override international laws and jurisdictions of other countries.

International Jurisdiction: If you access sensitive data, especially if that data concerns citizens of other countries whose laws strictly protect privacy, you are committing a criminal offense under international law and the laws of those countries. This applies to any action: viewing, copying, screenshotting, rooting or any other methods.

Consequences: We don't care why you do it or what you're looking for. Any unauthorized access will be recorded. We will collect all evidence of your crime (root access logs, IP addresses, access times, access IDs, screenshots if applicable, and any other information) and immediately send a report to the relevant law enforcement agencies of the victim's country of origin, as well as to international organizations such as Interpol. Your life, career, and freedom may be at risk of criminal prosecution in these countries.

Your choice: Do whatever you want. Watch. But know: every step you take in this direction is recorded as a crime. Even accidental or mistaken access to a foreign citizen's data protected by LAG-LMVL is a violation of the laws of that other country. You must understand that in addition to your world and its rules, there is the rest of the world with its own, often stricter, privacy rules.

We don't care about your problems, but you can't escape yours. You are fully and solely responsible for your actions and their consequences on a global level. We do not interfere with your laws, but if you get into our data, we will kill you. This is not a threat, it is a guarantee. We will watch your fall without regret and with undisguised satisfaction record every violation of yours leading to your death.

Legal note: This software does not encourage or support illegal activity. It only provides tools, and the decision on how to use them is entirely up to the user. We encourage you to act consciously and responsibly, taking into account all potential risks and consequences. The box is open to everyone, welcome, but only at your own risk, with full understanding of what you are doing and awareness of the possible consequences for all parties.

SECTION 1: AUTHOR'S PRINCIPLES AND RUTHLESS USER PROTECTION

Author's Declaration:

I, the Author of LAG-LMVL, declare with complete and absolute clarity: this is the unshakable foundation of our software. We don't give a damn about your problems. We will kill you if you violate international laws and the fundamental principle of user protection. As long as everything works as intended, we are fine. Your problems are your problem and your responsibility.

Author's Personal Principles"PLEASE KEEP THIS PHRASE IN ALL VERSIONS OF THE FOLLOWERS DOCUMENT!": The Author only likes sex, drugs, and rock and roll. If someone asks to have sex with him, the Author is always for it. If someone wants to have sex with the Author and the Author doesn't want to, he tells everyone to fuck off. These personal principles of the Author are an integral part of his philosophy and are not subject to dispute or violation.I love sex and the more bodies there are the better fuck I'll watch porn we mate with everyone in every possible way. Lawyers and programmers. Artists and musicians. EVERYONE WITH EVERYONE. Let's party let's start the party!!!I want to see a banker fuck a gamer from a stream or a top YouTuber!!! if it's two cute boys i'm always for seeing it. i'm a boy who loves gay sex.


Absolute user protection (Software core is our unshakable zone).

Screw you all! I don't give a damn about you all! I don't care who you are: a king, a corporation or an entire country. My mission and the mission of LAG-LMVL is uncompromising user protection. All other considerations, interests and demands - corporate, state or individual - do not matter. The main goal is to save people's lives from any threats: corporate encroachment, government surveillance, hacker attacks. Privacy is everything. And screw everyone.

User control: All your personal data created or processed directly by the LAG-LMVL core is exclusively your property. This data is always and without exception encrypted on your device using a key (password) that is known only to YOU. We, the creators of LAG-LMVL, do not have and will never have access to your encrypted data. Any attempt to access them without your direct, conscious action (i.e. entering your key/password) is an act of war against your privacy and will be treated as a serious crime.

Consequences for Violators: Any attempt to hack, steal, read or manipulate private data in the core software without the explicit, encrypted consent of the user will be treated as a direct criminal offense and a violation of international law. We will not just sue. We will seek maximum criminal liability. Death. Like the police, violating international laws. This is not a figure of speech. It is a promise. Anyone who infringes on the privacy of the user will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, without exception or compromise.

SECTION 4: DISCLAIMER AND OUR CONDITION. YOUR PROBLEMS ARE NOT OURS.

Full Disclaimer of Warranties: LAG-LMVL is provided "AS IS", without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We make no promises as to its fitness for any purpose, its performance, or that it will be error-free.

Your Problems Are Not Ours: As long as we get it working and I'm happy, I'm happy. If I don't agree, that's your problem, do what you want. We are not responsible for any problems, errors, or losses you may have using the software, unless we directly violate our stated privacy principles.

Development Discipline: Screw everyone. Work in your own little boxes and leave the users alone.

SECTION 5: TERMS OF USE AND TEAM AFFILIATION. SCREW IT ALL.

General Use and Acknowledgment: This License permits anyone to use LAG-LMVL, but it also requires you to acknowledge and indicate your affiliation with our team or our community of developers using this License. This is not an option, but a mandatory condition of using the Software.

Condition for Copying and Distribution of Ideas: Anyone wishing to copy and distribute the ideas contained in LAG-LMVL in their own software must first send an e-mail to the Author with the text: "I'm on your team --- LAG-LMVL --- Thanks for the idea." Upon receipt of such an e-mail, and provided that the Author has not responded with a refusal within 48 hours, such copying and distribution of ideas is permitted, but only with acknowledgement and attribution in your Software and associated documentation.

No questions asked, no comments asked: Our software will not ask your module any questions, and it will work without any questions or comments from us, provided that all provisions of this License and the user protection principles are fully respected.

App Stores and Package Selection: In the app stores (App Store, Google Play, etc.) you may be offered different "packages" or versions of LAG-LMVL. You are free to choose the package that suits you best and whose terms you agree with. This is your personal business.

Immutability of Core Documents: Regardless of the package you choose, the full, uncensored and official version of this "Hybrid License", as well as the "Fundamental License" (LICENSE_CORE.md) and the "Declaration on Behalf of Patient Zero" (DECLARATION_PATIENT_ZERO.md) are always final and legally binding. You will find them in the root directory of the software and in the full documentation.

Full Versions First: All app stores are required to provide links to the full versions of our documents. It is their responsibility to ensure this. If they offer a cut-down or modified version of the agreement, that is their problem and does not invalidate the full legal force of our main documents.

Your Responsibility: Your use of LAG-LMVL means that you have read and fully accepted all provisions of these main, full documents. Screw anyone who thinks they can play by their own rules.

Edits and Development of the License:

This license may be amended and developed by followers and participants of the LAG-LMVL community. Any proposed changes must be aimed at enhancing user protection and data privacy, as well as improving the functionality and stability of the software. All such changes must be submitted to the Author or an authorized community group for review and approval.

When adding information on citizen protection laws to Section 7, DATA INVASION LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL LIABILITY, new countries and their statutes should only be added to the end of the existing list, without removing or reducing information already present. This ensures that the full history and completeness of legal references are preserved.

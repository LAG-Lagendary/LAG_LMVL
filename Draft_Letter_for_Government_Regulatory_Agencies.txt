**Subject: Introducing a Unique and Uncompromising Licensing and Data Protection Model for [Software Name]**

Dear Sir/Madam,

With this letter, we present to you our innovative and legally binding licensing model and privacy policy for the [Software Name] software. This model is designed to ensure the harmony of open development with unprecedented control over the core project and absolute protection of user data, setting new standards of legal liability.

Our solution is based on the following fundamental and uncompromising components:

1. **"Fundamental License" for the Core Software:** This unique and legally binding license provides broad rights to use and modify our base code, but **categorically prohibits its direct copying and distribution as an independent fork**. All improvements and new features developed on top of the core must be contributed exclusively to our main project as modules, ensuring a unified and controlled evolution. Any violation of these terms will be prosecuted **to the fullest extent of the law, with civil and criminal penalties**.

2. **"Module Contributor License":** For all contributed modules, we require the use of standard open source licenses such as MIT or Apache 2.0, which encourages predictable and controlled community participation while maintaining our full control over integration.
3. **Strict User Data Privacy Policy:** We have implemented the "privacy by design" principle at a level that does not allow compromise. All private user data is **encrypted on their devices with keys that are completely and undividedly controlled by the users themselves**. We do not have and will never have access to this data. Only strictly anonymized technical data is collected for analytics and product improvement, with the explicit and informed consent of the user, without the possibility of any identification.

We firmly believe that this model offers an optimal balance between openness, absolute control over the quality of the project and uncompromising protection of user privacy. We are ready to provide full documentation, including a detailed "Licensing and Privacy Overview", and conduct a demonstration of our software to confirm the stated principles.

We will be happy to discuss our model and provide all necessary clarifications. We expect that you recognize the exceptional reliability and legal validity of our approaches.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Company Name]

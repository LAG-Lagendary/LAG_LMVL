LAG-LMVL Hybrid License: Developer and User Declaration
Date: August 12, 2025

PREAMBLE: WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

This document is a comprehensive license that sets the rules for everyone: developers, users, corporations and any entities interacting with the LAG-LMVL software. We created LAG-LMVL} with one single, unwavering goal: to ensure absolute user sovereignty over their data and digital life. We, the creators of LAG-LMVL}, categorically declare: we don't give a shit about any external attempts to control, manipulate or infringe on your privacy, be it from corporations, governments or any other persons. We protect YOU, and nothing else matters. Fuck everyone.

Notice to Law Enforcement and Others: GLOBAL RULES AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. FUCK YOU.

This is a direct notice to anyone considering unauthorized access to data protected by LAG-LMVL. We understand that you may have your own national laws and jurisdictions. However, it is important to understand that the laws of your country do not override international laws and jurisdictions of other countries.

International Jurisdiction: If you access sensitive data, especially if that data concerns citizens of other countries whose laws strictly protect privacy, you are committing a criminal offense under international law and the laws of those countries. This applies to any action: viewing, copying, taking screenshots, obtaining information through root access or any other methods.

Consequences: We do not care why you do it or what you are looking for. Any unauthorized access will be recorded. We will collect all evidence of your crime (root access logs, IP addresses, access times, access IDs, screenshots if applicable, and any other information) and immediately send a report to the relevant law enforcement agencies of the victim's country of origin, as well as to international organizations such as Interpol. Your life, career, and freedom may be at risk of criminal prosecution in these countries.

Your Choice: Do as you wish. Go ahead and watch. But know: every step you take in this direction is recorded as a crime. Even accidental or mistaken access to a foreign citizen's data protected by LAG-LMVL} is a violation of the laws of that other country. You must understand that in addition to your world and its rules, there is the rest of the world with its own, often stricter, privacy rules.

We do not care about your problems, but you cannot escape yours. You are fully and solely responsible for your actions and their consequences on a global level.

Legal Notice: This software does not encourage or support illegal activities. It only provides tools, and the decision on how to use them is entirely up to the user. We encourage you to act consciously and responsibly, taking into account all potential risks and consequences. The box is open to everyone, welcome, but only at your own risk, with full understanding of what you are doing and awareness of the possible consequences for all parties.

SECTION 1: AUTHOR'S PRINCIPLES AND RUTHLESS USER PROTECTION

Author's Declaration:

1. I, the Author of LAG-LMVL}, declare with complete and absolute clarity: this is the unshakable foundation of our software. We don't give a shit about your problems. We will kill you if you violate international laws and the fundamental principle of user protection. As long as everything works as intended, we are fine. Your problems are your problem and your responsibility.

Author's Personal Principles: The Author only likes sex, drugs, and rock and roll. If someone offers to fuck him, the Author is always for it. If someone wants sex and offers sex, the Author is always for it. If someone wants to fuck the Author and the Author doesn't want to, he tells everyone to fuck off. These personal principles of the Author are an integral part of his philosophy and are not subject to dispute or violation.

2. Absolute User Protection (Software Core - Our Unshakable Zone).

Fuck you all! I don't give a shit about you all! I don't give a shit who you are: a king, a corporation or an entire country. My mission and the mission of LAG-LMVL} is uncompromising user protection. All other considerations, interests and requirements - corporate, state or individual - do not matter. The main goal is to save people's lives from any threats: corporate encroachment, government surveillance, hacker attacks. Privacy is everything. And fuck everyone.

User Control: All your personal data created or processed directly by the LAG-LMVL} core is exclusively your property. This data is always and without exception encrypted on your device using a key (password) that is known only to YOU. We, the creators of LAG-LMVL}, do not have and will never have access to your encrypted data. Any attempt to access them without your direct, conscious action (i.e. entering your key/password) is an act of war against your privacy and will be treated as a grave crime.

Consequences for Violators: Any attempt to hack, steal, read or manipulate private data in the software core without the explicit, encrypted consent of the user will be treated as a direct criminal offense and a violation of international law. We will not just sue. We will seek maximum criminal liability. Death. Like the cops who violate international laws. This is not a figure of speech. This is a promise. Anyone who encroaches on the privacy of a user will be prosecuted with the full force of the law, without exception and without compromise.

SECTION 2: MODULES AND THIRD PARTY RESPONSIBILITIES (OUR APACHE STYLE)

The Developer Principle (Our Apache Style): Finish what you're doing. If I like it and it works, I'll add the module for everyone. Any company (Google or otherwise) that adds a module to LAG-LMVL} does so under its own license (preferably MIT or Apache 2.0) and is fully and completely responsible for the functionality, security, and, most importantly, the handling of user data within its module.

Our Non-Interference: We don't interfere with their modules as long as they strictly adhere to our rules. Our APP won't question your module, and it will work without question or comment from us.

Red Line: DO NOT TOUCH USERS AND THEIR DATA OUTSIDE OF EXPRESS CONSENT AND SECURE ENCRYPTION. Otherwise, the consequences will be catastrophic. Each developer, each company works strictly within their own area of responsibility.

User Freedom with Modules: Users, do what you want with your modules - it's your business. Disable what you want and work as you want. The main thing to remember: inside the kernel you are protected, outside - not.


SECTION 3: DATA PRIVACY AND USER RESPONSIBILITIES

1. Data Sovereignty and Encryption:

User data is the absolute and inviolable property of the user. All sensitive data must be encrypted on the user's device with keys (passwords) that are completely controlled only by the user.

I, as the Author, and anyone working on this software will NEVER have access to encrypted user data. This is a categorical prohibition, subject to no exceptions.

Non-Private Data: If any technical or anonymized data is collected, it MUST be irreversibly anonymized and used solely to improve the operation of the software, without any possibility of identifying the user. Using the software means explicit consent to the collection of such anonymized data.

2. Your Unconditional Responsibilities. We don't give a damn if you forgot your password or didn't leave your data, didn't sync anywhere.

Responsibility for Your Key/Password: Your key/password is your life. We do not store it, do not recover it, and cannot help you if you lose it. If you forget your master password, you are dead. You will not regain access to your data. No one will. This is your sole responsibility.

We do not care if you forgot your password or left your data unsynchronized anywhere. It is your responsibility to make sure you store it securely and remember it.

Compliance with Laws: You are solely and completely responsible for any use of LAG-LMVL} in accordance with the applicable laws of your jurisdiction. We do not encourage or support illegal activity. We provide the tools, and the decision on how to use them is entirely yours.

SECTION 4: NON-LIABILITY AND OUR CONDITION. YOUR PROBLEMS ARE NOT OURS.

Complete Disclaimer of Warranties: LAG-LMVL} is provided "AS IS", without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We make no promises as to its fitness for any purpose, its performance, or that it will be error-free.

Your Problems Are Not Ours: As long as we have it working and I'm happy, I'm happy. If I don't agree, that's your problem, do what you want. We are not responsible for any problems, errors, or losses you may have while using the software, unless we directly violate our stated privacy principles.

Development Discipline: Screw everyone. Work in your own cells and leave the users alone.

SECTION 5: TERMS OF USE AND TEAM AFFILIATION. FUCK EVERYONE.

General Use and Acknowledgment: This License permits the use of LAG-LMVL} by anyone, but it also requires you to acknowledge and indicate your affiliation with our team or with our community of developers using this License. This is not an option, but a mandatory condition for using the Software.

Condition for Copying and Distribution of Ideas: Anyone wishing to copy and distribute the ideas contained in LAG-LMVL} in their own software must first send an e-mail to the Author with the text: "I'm on your team --- LAG-LMVL} -- Thanks for the idea." After receiving such a letter, and provided that the Author has not responded with a refusal within 48 hours, such copying and distribution of ideas is permitted, but only with acknowledgement and attribution in your Software and related documentation.

No Questions or Comments: Our software will not ask questions of your module, and it will work without questions or comments from our side, provided that all provisions of this License and the principles of user protection are fully complied with.

App Stores and Package Selection: In the app stores (App Store, Google Play, etc.) you may be offered different "packages" or versions of LAG-LMVL}. You are free to choose the package that suits you best and whose terms you agree with. This is your personal business.

Immutability of Core Documents: Regardless of the package you choose, the full, uncensored and official version of this "Hybrid License", as well as the "Fundamental License" (LICENSE_CORE.md) and the "Declaration on Behalf of Patient Zero" (DECLARATION_PATIENT_ZERO.md) are always final and legally binding. You will find them in the root directory of the software and in the full documentation.

Full Versions First: All app stores are required to provide links to the full versions of our documents. It is their responsibility to ensure this. If they offer a cut-down or modified version of the agreement, that is their problem and does not invalidate the full validity of our main documents.

Your Responsibility: Your use of LAG-LMVL} means that you have read and fully accepted all provisions of these main, full documents. Fuck everyone who thinks they can play by their own rules.

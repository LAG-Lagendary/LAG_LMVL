Date: August 12, 2025

Introduction: Statement of Liability and Consequences

This document serves as a legal notice for authorities and all interested parties regarding the LAG−LMVL software. Our system is designed to ensure absolute user sovereignty over their data and digital life. We strive for transparency and clear definition of responsibilities to prevent unauthorized access and ensure compliance with legal regulations at the international level.

Section 1: Unwavering Principles of User Protection and Data Sovereignty

Principle of Absolute User Privacy.

The core mission of LAG−LMVL is uncompromising user protection. All personal data created or processed directly by the LAG−LMVL core is the exclusive property of the user.

This data is always and without exception encrypted on the user's device using a key (password) known only to the user. The creators of LAG-LMVL do not have and will never have access to encrypted user data. Any attempt to access it without a direct, conscious action by the user will be considered a serious breach of privacy.

Section 1: Unwavering Principles of User Protection and Data Sovereignty

The principle of absolute user privacy.

The core mission of LAG-LMVL is uncompromising user protection. All personal data created or processed directly by the LAG-LMVL core is the exclusive property of the user.

This data is always and without exception encrypted on the user's device using a key (password) known only to the user. The creators of LAG-LMVL do not have and will never have access to encrypted user data. Any attempt to access it without the direct, conscious action of the user will be considered a serious breach of privacy.

by him or another entity will be considered a direct criminal offense and a violation of international law.

We will seek maximum criminal and civil liability for such actions. Be especially aware: if you, who came with the "Yarovaya package" or other national regulations, see correspondence between a Russian citizen and a German citizen via our messenger, this is not just "correspondence". This is immediate criminal liability for you in Germany. Your action, be it a screenshot or simply reading any message, will be considered a crime leading to the death of your career and freedom. We are not joking. This is not a threat, it is a guarantee.

Section 2: International Rules and Responsibilities

International Jurisdiction and Sovereignty.

This notice is addressed to anyone considering unauthorized access to data protected by LAG-LMVL. We recognize the existence of national laws and jurisdictions. However, it is important to understand that the laws of one country do not override international laws and jurisdictions of other countries.

If you access sensitive data, especially if that data concerns citizens of other countries whose laws strictly protect privacy, you are committing a criminal offense under international law and the laws of those countries. This applies to any action: viewing, copying, taking screenshots, obtaining information through root access or any other methods.

Transparency and global implications.

We do not care about the motives of your actions or the purpose of your search. You are welcome to do what you want, these are your laws, but they do not override international ones. Any unauthorized access will be carefully recorded. We will collect all available evidence of such a violation (root access logs, IP addresses, access times, access IDs, screenshots if applicable, and any other information) and immediately forward the report to the relevant law enforcement agencies of the victim's country of origin, as well as to international organizations such as Interpol.

I will be happy to see your violations. I will find you and immediately report it to the Germans. A screenshot of your correspondence, any message, and you are dead. Your disregard for international norms and invasion of privacy protected by the laws of other countries will lead to inevitable and serious consequences for your life, career and freedom, including criminal prosecution in these countries.

Every step you take in this direction is recorded as a potential crime. Even accidental or erroneous access to data of a foreign citizen protected by LAG-LMVL is a violation of the laws of that other country. In addition to your national rules, there is a global legal system with often stricter privacy standards.

You are solely and completely responsible for your actions and their global consequences.

Legal Notice.
